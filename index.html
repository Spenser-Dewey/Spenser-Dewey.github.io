  </div>

  <p style="margin-top: 14rem; font-size: 1.25em;">
    My name is Spenser Dewey. I'm currently a senior at Northeastern University, studying Computer Engineering
    and Computer Science with a minor in Robotics.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">
    I've messed around with lots of different types of technology, from database design and web development to
    FPGA programming. I'm primarily interested in firmware, embedded programming, and robotics, but
    I do enjoy working in other areas as well.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">
    Outside of the internet, I enjoy playing board games, hiking, and reading sci-fi or fantasy novels.
