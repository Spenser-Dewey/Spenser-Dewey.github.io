      <h3>Tabletop RPG Helper IP</h3>
      <p>
        Built to help players of tabletop RPG games keep track of NPCs, locations, and other information that comes up in a DND-type game. Tracks

      <h3>Generic Cellular Automata</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a program which can run any cellular automata, given it's set of rules. The most famous automata is probably
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. Generally, for the purposes of this program,
        a cellular automata is a set of cells which can each be in some state from a finite set of states, and they can transition from that 
        state into another state based on their own state and the state of their neighbors. We created 1D, 2D, and 3D cellular automata examples
        in the repository; rules are specified in JSON. The one that runs is the one labeled 'startup.json'.

      <h3>'Hackarona' Drink Catalog</h3>
      <p>
        Built as part of an AWS sponsored hackathon for Constellation Brands interns. This was a django website which gave cocktail recommendations
        based on which ingredients and Constellation products you owned. We allowed users to take photos of constellation products, and we would
        determine which product it was, and suggest recipes based on it. One of the goals was to use AWS services, so we hit as many as we reasonably
        could along the way; we ran the app on an EC2, we stored user images in S3 buckets, and we ran AWS lambdas to process the photos with AWS Textract,
        and finally logging to AWS cloudwatch. There was an existing collection of recipes that Constellation had put together, which we used.

        This website won Crowd Favorite at the hackathon.
